F3 supports both SQL and NoSQL databases off-the-shelf: MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL/Sybase, PostgreSQL and MongoDB. It also comes with powerful object-relational mappers for data abstraction and modeling that are just as lightweight as the framework. No configuration needed.

That's not all. F3 is packaged with other optional plug-ins that extend its capabilities:

* Fast and clean template engine
* Unit testing toolkit
* Database-managed sessions
* Markdown-to-HTML converter
* Atom/RSS feed reader
* Image processor
* Geodata handler
* On-the-fly Javascript/CSS compressor
* OpenID (consumer)
* Custom logger
* Basket/Shopping cart
* Pingback server/consumer
* Unicode-aware string functions
* SMTP over SSL/TLS
* Tools for communicating with other servers

Unlike other frameworks, F3 aims to be usable - not usual.

The philosophy behind the framework and its approach to software architecture is towards minimalism in structural components, avoiding application complexity and striking a balance between code elegance, application performance and programmer productivity.
